# robma\_builder
![CI master](https://github.com/RobMa/robma_builder/workflows/Continuous%20integration/badge.svg?branch=master)


My result of the builder exercise in the excellent [proc-macro-workshop](https://github.com/dtolnay/proc-macro-workshop) by David Tolnay.
I strongly recommend checking out this workshop to anyone who would like to get started with procedural macros in rust.

This is a personal learning project, do **not** use in production and consider [rust-derive-builder](https://crates.io/crates/derive_builder) instead.
